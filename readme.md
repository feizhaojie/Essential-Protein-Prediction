# Essential Protein Prediction

This repo is about using **Gene Spetrum** data and **Protein Topology** data to predict essential protein.

The code involves two models in deep learning:
* Convolutional Neural Network [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1408.5882)
* Node2vec [paper](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2939754)
